What is a Leave Tracking System?

      A Leave Tracking System helps organizations manage employee time-off requests that allows employees to:
      Submit leave requests
      Check leave balances
      View request status
      Cancel pending requests
      
Leave tracking systems allow managers to:

      Review leave requests
      Approve or deny leave requests
      Generate reports on team availability
      
Why use this case study?

      Leave tracking is an excellent example for learning object-oriented programming because the leave system:
      Contains real-world objects (employees, leave requests, leave types)
      Demonstrates relationships between objects
      Involves data management and business rules
      Scales from simple to complex implementations
